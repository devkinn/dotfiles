# dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files for Linux. I try to keep my dotfiles as minimal as possible to avoid extensive management and focus on the actual work. Doesn't always work out though. Messing with config files is fun :)

## Current setup

- Distro: Fedora Linux
- DE: Cosmic
- Shell: Bash
- Terminal: Alacritty
- Editor: Neovim - LazyVim

## Additional tools

- zoxide: for fast file system navigation
- starship.rs: for contextual prompt
- tmux: terminal multiplexer
- lazygit: easier repository management

## Closing thoughts

I'm currently checking out [devpod.sh](https://devpod.sh/). It's a great tool for managing workspaces for different repositories and keeping your host system clean of many dependencies and tools.
