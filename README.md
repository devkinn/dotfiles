# dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files for Linux. I try to keep my dotfiles as minimal as possible to avoid extensive management and focus on the actual work. Doesn't always work out though. Messing with config files is fun :)

## Current setup

- Distro: Fedora Linux
- DE: Cosmic
- Shell: Bash
- Terminal: Alacritty
- Editor: Neovim - LazyVim

## Additional tools

- zoxide: for fast file system navigation
- starship.rs: for contextual prompt
- tmux: terminal multiplexer
- lazygit: easier repository management
- toolbox: for isolated development environments
